## Dictionary additions
Which dictionary do I add this flagged word to?
* If it's spelled correctly and used in:
  * the Path of Exile game: `poe-dict.txt`.
  * the POB source code / git repository: `pob-dict.txt`.
* If it's spelled *incorrectly* but you don't want to be warned about it: `ignore-dict.txt`  Please try to make these as specific as possible to eliminate unwanted false negatives in future.

Examples:
| Word            | Dictionary          | Reason
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------------
| Atziri          | `poe-dict.txt`      | Correct spelling of POE NPC.
| REGENPERCENT    | `pob-dict.txt`      | Correct combination of two words, used in POB source code.
| Lilylicious     | `pob-dict.txt`      | Correct spelling of a POB contributor's name/handle.
| CritsDontAlways | `ignore-dict.txt`   | Incorrect spelling but we are aware and don't want a warning. *(1)*

*(1)* Note that just adding the word "dont" to the ignore dict would most likely create unwanted false negatives elsewhere.
